# Code up your own calculator from the lecture. Make sure you can 
#   run it from the command line. Save the calculator file in a 
#   directory, and initialize the directory as a git repository. 
#   Make sure this isn't nested in another existing git repository. 
#   Then, push this git repository to Github.

# Hint: review this section on “do/while” loops on how to keep asking 
#   for input until some condition is met:
